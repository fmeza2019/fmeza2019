In the summer 2021, I took a GIS course based in R. I learned how to write code, understand the meaning behind what I did and the importance it has in the field. There were some date science activities that I did and below there is a collection of links to this work. 

## [Building a project website](https://github.com/fmeza2019/fmeza2019)

- In this activity I learned to create a user site with Github Pages.
- Used Rstudio to link and create this site. 
- Created and organized project files.
- Wrote code to construct website pages.
- Personalized website appearance and style.
